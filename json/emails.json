    "intro": "Our startup ARTIST SHOPPIE is all about clothing solutions. Women love to mix and match their outfits and wear them differently every time but this gets limited when it comes to evening and party wear as the bottoms and tops are fixed and cannot be mixed with any other option like in the case of a lehanga so we are trying to design clothes which are detacheable so a lehenga becomes an anarkali or a gown for that matter and when the customer wants and can again be transformed into a lehenga. Another scheme that we have recently launched is called ABRA-KA-DABRA. Here the customers give us the clothes that they not longer use and want to get a makeover done. We transform the plain dull clothes into some cool stuff to wear by customizing it according to their whims and fancies. The other idea that we are working on is providing the customers the designer clothes on hire. We named it CLOSET ON HIRE. Where people can take the designer outfits on a very low cost and there by need not go buy stuff for every small occasion.",
